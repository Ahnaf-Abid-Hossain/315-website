      <p>I volunteered at the <a href="http://bcsmarathon.com/best-race-texas/">BCS marathon</a> last semester. It was a fantastic event and me and my group served the runners water, snacks and other refreshment. It was a wonderful experience doing this and it was very inspiring to see all the runner. There were people from all ages running such a long marathon.
