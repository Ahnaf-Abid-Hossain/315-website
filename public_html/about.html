      <h1>Origin and Hobbies</h1>
      
	  <p>I come from <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"> Bangladesh</a> and I moved here on April of 2018. Most of my life I have lived there and I miss it dearly. Moving to the US has been incredibly difficult at times due to the cultural and societal differences. But after spending 4 years here, I and my family have settled in. But this is a long and grueling process. First couple of months I had troubles speaking in English. I wasn't fluent and I had a tough time making friends. My family went through the same problems. My mother was living here trying to get a job while making sure me and my sister weren't stuggling as well. It was a hard time for all of us. But these circumstances made me more serious about my future. It fueled me to try harder and overcome my fears. I started talking to more people so that I can improve my speaking skills. I started teaching my mom and sister how to speak better as well at home. I started walking to my sisters school and brought her back home and cooked and fed her. I also got a job at a place where I taught kids how to code. I was doing something I was passionate about and learned English on the way as well. All of these events taught me humility, and taught me how to stand up for myself. And now I made it to one of the best Engineering colleges of the nation. I am proud of my accomplishments. 
		<br> <br> I love to play tennis	and video games. I used to play varsity tennis in highschool. Even though it is much harder to make time for sports, I still try to play often. And I started playing the <a href="https://diablo2.blizzard.com/en-us/">Diablo </a>series recently. It is very fun and very unique. All the levels change every time I enter the game so it feels fresh and challenging and I love it. From last year, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> was my favorite game. It will go down as one of the best games ever made for me.
